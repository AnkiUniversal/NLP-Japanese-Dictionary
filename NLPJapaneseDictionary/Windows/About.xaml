                        The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
                        research and development conducted during the project and is provided
                        to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the

                        Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
                        have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
                        the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or

                        In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
